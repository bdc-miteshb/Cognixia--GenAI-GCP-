You are an expert Python developer. I have a FastAPI application with endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and listing orders. The app uses:
- Pydantic models for validation.
- Authorization via `Authorization` header (Bearer token).
- ETag for concurrency control on PUT.
- Pagination with `limit` and `offset` query params.

Write a pytest test file using `fastapi.testclient.TestClient` that:
1. Creates a fixture for the client.
2. Tests the happy path: create an order and then retrieve it.
3. Tests authorization failures for missing, empty, and wrong tokens.
4. Tests pagination behavior, including server-side limit cap.
5. Tests that PUT requires a correct ETag and fails with stale or missing ETag.
6. Tests validation errors for:
   - Empty `user_id`
   - Negative `amount`
   - Invalid currency format

Important details for numeric fields:
- When asserting `amount`, do NOT compare raw strings like `"30.00"`. Instead, convert to `Decimal` or `float` for equality:
  ```python
  from decimal import Decimal
  assert Decimal(resp.json()["amount"]) == Decimal("30.00")
