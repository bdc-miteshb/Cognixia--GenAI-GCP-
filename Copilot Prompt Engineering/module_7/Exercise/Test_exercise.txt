Question: How would you use prompt to generate test cases checking stacking limit enforcement?
Answer: "Generate test cases to confirm only two discounts apply when more than two coupons or memberships are used"

Task 4: Test discount cap using prompt
Question: What prompt creates manual test cases to verify discount cap of 60 percent?
Answer: "Generate manual test cases verifying discount cap at 60 percent of subtotal and inclusion of discount_cap_applied flag"

Question: How would you use prompt to confirm rounding occurs correctly at each computation stage?
Answer: "Generate test cases validating rounding of subtotal, discounts, tax, and total to two decimals at each stage"
