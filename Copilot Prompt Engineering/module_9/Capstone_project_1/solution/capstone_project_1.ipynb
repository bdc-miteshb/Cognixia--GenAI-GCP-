    "    Streamlit Authentication Flow Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication Flow Overview\n",
    "The authentication system follows a classic three-layer architecture where user credentials flow from the presentation layer through business logic to data persistence, with each layer having distinct responsibilities.\n",
    "Key Components in Login Process\n",
    "Frontend Layer - User Interface\n",
    "The frontend handles user interaction through Streamlit components. When a user attempts to login, the interface captures username and password through text input fields. The login button triggers validation and passes credentials to the authentication service. After receiving a response, it manages session state to track logged-in users and handles UI updates including success messages, error displays, and page redirects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication Layer - Business Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "This middle layer orchestrates the entire authentication workflow. It receives raw credentials from the frontend and performs input validation to ensure both username and password are provided. The critical security step happens here where plain text passwords get hashed using SHA-256 before any database interaction. It then coordinates with the database layer to verify credentials and formats the response data appropriately, ensuring sensitive information like passwords never get returned to the frontend.\n",
    "Database Layer - Data Persistence\n",
    "The data layer manages all database interactions through SQLite connections. It executes parameterized SQL queries to search for users matching both username and hashed password. The layer handles connection management, ensures proper resource cleanup, and provides error handling for database operations. It returns raw user data or None based on whether matching credentials exist.\n",
    "Security Implementation\n",
    "The system implements several security measures starting with password hashing where plain text passwords never get stored in the database. All passwords are immediately hashed using SHA-256 before storage or comparison. The database layer uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks, though there are some bugs in the current implementation that create vulnerabilities.\n",
    "Session management occurs entirely on the frontend using Streamlit's session state mechanism. When authentication succeeds, the system stores user information in session variables to maintain login status across page interactions. The session gets cleared when users logout, ensuring proper security boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication Workflow Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The login process begins when users enter credentials and click the login button. The frontend performs basic validation checking for non-empty inputs, though it currently has a bug allowing whitespace-only entries. Valid inputs get passed to the authentication layer.\n",
    "The business logic layer takes over by validating inputs more thoroughly and immediately hashing the provided password using SHA-256. It then calls the database layer with the username and hashed password for credential verification.\n",
    "Database verification involves executing a SQL query that searches for records matching both the provided username and hashed password. The query uses parameterized statements for security and returns user data excluding the password field for safety.\n",
    "Response processing occurs when the authentication layer receives database results. If a user record exists, it formats a success response with user details. If no match exists, it returns a failure response with an appropriate error message.\n",
    "Finally, session management happens as the frontend processes the authentication response. Successful logins update session state with user information and redirect to the dashboard. Failed attempts display error messages while keeping users on the login page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Flow Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "User credentials flow unidirectionally from frontend input through authentication processing to database verification. The response flows back through the same layers, with each layer transforming data appropriately. The frontend handles user interaction, the authentication layer manages business rules and security, and the database layer provides persistence and retrieval.\n",
    "This separation ensures security by keeping password hashing in the business layer, input validation distributed across layers, and database access controlled through a dedicated data access layer. The architecture supports maintainability by allowing independent modification of each layer without affecting others."
